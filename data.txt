We use ﬁnite-horizon, and optionally discounted, reward functions to heuristically ﬁnd a suitable placement and routing policy.

We benchmark our transpiler against multiple alternative solutions and on various test sets of quantum algorithms to demonstrate the beneﬁts of our approach.},

abstract = {It is imperative to compile quantum circuits for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices because of the limited connectivity of physical qubits and the high error rates of gate operations. One of the most critical steps in quantum circuit compilation is qubit routing, an NP-Hard problem that involves placing and moving logical qubits to minimize compilation overhead. In this study, we propose ISing mAchine Assisted Quantum compiler (ISAAQ) to perform qubit routing with Ising machines, which can efficiently solve Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. ISAAQ accurately estimates the compilation costs by updating itself using previous compilation results, and accelerates qubit routing by solving QUBO problems in parallel with multiple Ising machines. In addition, ISAAQ exploits a cost-reduction method that implements commutative logical Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates with fewer physical CNOT gates, which is particularly effective for planar devices when implementing original gates. Experimental results on both IBM QX5 and IBM QX20 show that ISAAQ outperforms the heuristic methods available in Qiskit and tket, as well as an existing QUBO method, requiring fewer physical CNOT gates for most benchmark circuits. ISAAQ performs particularly well on large circuits, demonstrating its strong scalability with respect to the number of logical CNOT gates.},

abstract = {Quantum computing is gaining more and more attention due to its huge potential and the constant progress in quantum computer development. IBM and Google have released quantum architectures with more than 50 qubits. However, in these machines, the physical qubits are not fully connected so that two-qubit interaction can only be performed between specific pairs of the physical qubits. To execute a quantum circuit, it is necessary to transform it into a functionally equivalent one that respects the constraints imposed by the target architecture. Quantum circuit transformation inevitably introduces additional gates which reduces the fidelity of the circuit. Therefore, it is important that the transformation method completes the transformation with minimal overheads. It consists of two steps, initial mapping and qubit routing. Here we propose a reinforcement learning-based model to solve the initial mapping problem. Initial mapping is formulated as sequence-to-sequence learning and self- attention network is used to extract features from a circuit. For qubit routing, a DEAR (Dynamically-Extract-and-Route) framework is proposed. The framework iteratively extracts a subcircuit and uses A* search to determine when and where to insert additional gates. It helps to preserve the lookahead ability dynamically and to provide more accurate cost estimation efficiently during A* search. The experimental results show that our RL-model generates better initial mappings than the best known algorithms with 12% fewer additional gates in the qubit routing stage. Furthermore, our DEAR- framework outperforms the state-of-the-art qubit routing approach with 8.4% and 36.3% average reduction in the number of additional gates and execution time starting from the same initial mapping.},

To mitigate the adverse effects of hardware noise, it is necessary to understand the effect of hardware noise on the program output and more fundamentally, understand the impact of hardware noise on specific regions within a quantum program. Identifying and optimizing regions that are more noise-sensitive is the key to expanding the capabilities of NISQ computers. Toward achieving that goal, we propose Charter, a novel technique to pinpoint specific gates and regions within a quantum program that are the most affected by the hardware noise and that have the highest impact on the program output. Using Charter's methodology, programmers can obtain a precise understanding of how different components of their code affect the output and optimize those components without the need for non-scalable quantum simulation on classical computers.},

abstract = {Because of the largest number of qubits available, and the massive parallel execution of entangling two-qubit gates, atom arrays is a promising platform for quantum computing. The qubits are selectively loaded into arrays of optical traps, some of which can be moved during the computation itself. By adjusting the locations of the traps and shining a specific global laser, different pairs of qubits, even those initially far away, can be entangled at different stages of the quantum program execution. In comparison, previous QC architectures only generate entanglement on a fixed set of quantum register pairs. Thus, reconfigurable atom arrays (RAA) present a new challenge for QC compilation, especially the qubit mapping/layout synthesis stage which decides the qubit placement and gate scheduling. In this paper, we consider an RAA QC architecture that contains multiple arrays, supports 2D array movements, represents cutting-edge experimental platforms, and is much more general than previous works. We start by systematically examining the fundamental constraints on RAA imposed by physics. Built upon this understanding, we discretize the state space of the architecture, and we formulate layout synthesis for such an architecture to a satisfactory modulo theories problem. Finally, we demonstrate our work by compiling the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), one of the promising near-term quantum computing applications. Our layout synthesizer reduces the number of required native two-qubit gates in 22-qubit QAOA by 5.72x (geomean) compared to leading experiments on a superconducting architecture. Combined with a better coherence time, there is an order-of-magnitude increase in circuit fidelity.},

abstract = {Layout synthesis in quantum circuits maps the logical qubits of a synthesized circuit onto the physical qubits of a hardware device (coupling graph) and complies with the hardware limitations. Existing studies on the problem usually suffer from intractable formulation complexity and thus prohibitively long runtimes. In this paper, we propose an efficient layout synthesizer by developing a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)-based qubit mapping checker. The proposed qubit mapping checker can efficiently derive a SWAP- free solution if one exists. If no SWAP-free solution exists for a circuit, we propose a divide-and-conquer scheme that utilizes the checker to find SWAP-free sub-solutions for sub-circuits, and the overall solution is found by merging sub-solutions with SWAP insertion. Experimental results show that the proposed optimization flow can achieve more than 3000X runtime speedup over a state- of-the-art work to derive optimal solutions for a set of SWAP-free circuits. Moreover, for the other set of benchmark circuits requiring SWAP gates, our flow achieves more than 800X speedup and obtains near-optimal solutions with only 3% SWAP overhead.},

Yet, the existing qubit mapping schemes meet some challenges (e.g., crosstalk, SWAP overheads, diverse device topologies, etc.), leading to qubit resource under-utilization, high error rate, and low ﬁdelity in computing results. This paper presents QuCloud+, a new qubit mapping scheme capable of handling these challenges. QuCloud+ has several new designs. (1) QuCloud+ enables multi-programming quantum computing on quantum chips with 2D/3D topology. (2) It partitions physical qubits for concurrent quantum programs with the crosstalk-aware community detection technique and further allocates qubits according to qubit degree, improving ﬁdelity and resource utilization. (3) QuCloud+ includes an X-SWAP mechanism that avoids SWAPs with high crosstalk errors and enables inter-program SWAPs to reduce the SWAP overheads. (4) QuCloud+ schedules concurrent quantum programs to be mapped and executed based on estimated ﬁdelity for the best practice. QuCloud+ outperforms the previous multi-programming work on various devices by 6.84% on ﬁdelity and saves 40.9% additional gates required during mapping transition.},

abstract = {Crosstalk is one of the major types of noise in quantum computers. To design high-fidelity quantum gates and large-scale quantum computers, effectively suppressing crosstalk is becoming increasingly important. Previous approaches to mitigate crosstalk rely on either hardware strategies, which are only applicable on limited platforms, or software techniques, which, however, cannot fully explore instruction parallelism. To address the above challenges, we propose a commutativity based compile-time instruction reordering approach. We first propose a complete set of generalized commutativity rules for main types of quantum gates, and then we design a two-level bidirectional reordering algorithm to reorder gates according to these rules for effective crosstalk mitigation. Our approach can not only capture both forward and backward instruction correlations but also reduce the effect of decoherence. We evaluate our approach with 117 quantum programs. Compared with the state-of-the-art, our approach can improve program fidelity by up to 120% (18% on average).},

abstract = {Computationally expensive applications, including machine learning, chemical simulations, and financial modeling, are promising candidates for noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers. In these problems, one important challenge is mapping a quantum circuit onto NISQ hardware while satisfying physical constraints of an underlying quantum architecture. Quantum circuit compilation (QCC) aims to generate feasible mappings such that a quantum circuit can be executed in a given hardware platform with acceptable confidence in outcomes. Physical constraints of a NISQ computer change frequently, requiring QCC process to be repeated often. When a circuit cannot directly be executed on a quantum hardware due to its physical limitations, it is necessary to modify the circuit by adding new quantum gates and auxiliary qubits, increasing its space and time complexity. An inefficient QCC may significantly increase error rate and circuit latency for even the simplest algorithms. In this article, we present artificial intelligence (AI)-based and heuristic-based methods recently reported in the literature that attempt to address these QCC challenges. We group them based on underlying techniques that they implement, such as AI algorithms including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant colony optimization and AI planning, and heuristics methods employing greedy algorithms, satisfiability problem solvers, dynamic, and graph optimization techniques. We discuss performance of each QCC technique and evaluate its potential limitations.},

The possibility of programming an actual quantum device has elicited much enthusiasm. Yet, quantum programming still lacks the compiler support that modern programming languages enjoy today. To use universal quantum computers like IBM's, programmers must design low-level circuits. In particular, they must map logical qubits into physical qubits that need to obey connectivity constraints. This task resembles the early days of programming, in which software was built in machine languages. In this paper, we formally introduce the qubit allocation problem and provide an exact solution to it. This optimal algorithm deals with the simple quantum machinery available today; however, it cannot scale up to the more complex architectures scheduled to appear. Thus, we also provide a heuristic solution to qubit allocation, which is faster than the current solutions already implemented to deal with this problem.},

Here, certain physical constraints given by the architectures which restrict the allowed interactions of the involved qubits have to be satisfied. Thus far, this has been addressed by inserting SWAP and H operations. However, it remains unknown whether existing methods add a minimum number of SWAP and H operations or, if not, how far they are away from that minimum—an NP-complete problem. In this work, we address this by formulating the mapping task as a symbolic optimization problem that is solved using reasoning engines like Boolean satisfiability solvers. By this, we do not only provide a method that maps quantum circuits to IBM’s QX architectures with a minimal number of SWAP and H operations, but also show by experimental evaluation that the number of operations added by IBM’s heuristic solution exceeds the lower bound by more than 100% on average.

abstract = {In the past years, quantum computers more and more have evolved from an academic idea to an upcoming reality. IBM’s project IBM ${Q}$ can be seen as evidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to provide access to quantum computers for a broad audience, this allowed users to conduct quantum experiments on a 5-qubit and, since June 2017, also on a 16-qubit quantum computer (called IBM QX2 and IBM QX3, respectively). Revised versions of these 5- and 16-qubit quantum computers (named IBM QX4 and IBM QX5, respectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these, the desired quantum functionality (e.g., provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has to be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied—a complex task. This demands solutions to automatically and efficiently conduct this mapping process. In this paper, we propose a methodology which addresses this problem, i.e., maps the given quantum functionality to a realization which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and, at the same time, keeps the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum gates minimal. The proposed methodology is generic, can easily be configured for similar future architectures, and is fully integrated into IBM’s SDK. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms IBM’s own mapping solution. In fact, for many quantum circuits, the proposed approach determines a mapping to the IBM architecture within minutes, while IBM’s solution suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 h in several cases. As an additional benefit, the proposed approach yields mapped circuits with smaller costs (i.e., fewer additional gates are required). All implementations of the proposed methodology are publicly available at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/ibm_qx_mapping.},

Such systems with few tens to few hundreds of qubits are termed as Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum computers (NISQ), and these systems can provide benefits for a class of quantum algorithms. In this paper, we study the problems of Qubit-Allocation (mapping of program qubits to machine qubits) and Qubit-Movement (routing qubits from one location to another for entanglement). We observe that there can be variation in the error rates of different qubits and links, which can impact the decisions for qubit movement and qubit allocation. We analyze publicly available characterization data for the IBM-Q20 to quantify the variation and show that there is indeed significant variability in the error rates of the qubits and the links connecting them. We show that the device variability has a significant impact on the overall system reliability. To exploit the variability in error rate, we propose Variation-Aware Qubit Movement (VQM) and Variation-Aware Qubit Allocation (VQA), policies that optimize the movement and allocation of qubits to avoid the weaker qubits and links, and guide more operations towards the stronger qubits and links. Our evaluations, with a simulation-based model of IBM-Q20, show that Variation-Aware policies can improve the system reliability by up to 1.7x. We also evaluate our policies on the IBM-Q5 machine and demonstrate that our proposal significantly improves the reliability of real systems (up to 1.9X).},

abstract = {A massive gap exists between current quantum computing (QC) prototypes, and the size and scale required for many proposed QC algorithms. Current QC implementations are prone to noise and variability which affect their reliability, and yet with less than 80 quantum bits (qubits) total, they are too resource-constrained to implement error correction. The term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) refers to these current and near-term systems of 1000 qubits or less. Given NISQ's severe resource constraints, low reliability, and high variability in physical characteristics such as coherence time or error rates, it is of pressing importance to map computations onto them in ways that use resources efficiently and maximize the likelihood of successful runs. This paper proposes and evaluates backend compiler approaches to map and optimize high-level QC programs to execute with high reliability on NISQ systems with diverse hardware characteristics. Our techniques all start from an LLVM intermediate representation of the quantum program (such as would be generated from high-level QC languages like Scaffold) and generate QC executables runnable on the IBM Q public QC machine. We then use this framework to implement and evaluate several optimal and heuristic mapping methods. These methods vary in how they account for the availability of dynamic machine calibration data, the relative importance of various noise parameters, the different possible routing strategies, and the relative importance of compile-time scalability versus runtime success. Using real-system measurements, we show that fine grained spatial and temporal variations in hardware parameters can be exploited to obtain an average 2.9x (and up to 18x) improvement in program success rate over the industry standard IBM Qiskit compiler. Despite small qubit counts, NISQ systems will soon be large enough to demonstrate "quantum supremacy", i.e., an advantage over classical computing. Tools like ours provide significant improvements in program reliability and execution time, and offer high leverage in accelerating progress towards quantum supremacy.},

abstract = {Ensuring nearest neighbor compliance of quantum circuits by inserting SWAP gates has heavily been considered in the past. Here, quantum gates are considered which work on non-adjacent qubits. SWAP gates are applied in order to “move” these qubits onto adjacent positions. However, a decision how exactly the SWAPs are “moved” has mainly been made without considering the effect a “movement” of qubits may have on the remaining circuit. In this work, we propose a methodology for nearest neighbor optimization which addresses this problem by means of a look-ahead scheme. To this end, two representative implementations are presented and discussed in detail. Experimental evaluations show that, in the best case, reductions in the number of SWAP gates of 56% (compared to the state-of-the-art methods) can be achieved following the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {Regular, local-neighbor topologies of quantum architectures restrict interactions to adjacent qubits, which in turn increases the latency of quantum circuits mapped to these architectures. To alleviate this effect, optimization methods that consider qubit-to-qubit interactions in 2D grid architectures are presented in this paper. The proposed approaches benefit from Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation for the qubit placement problem. Simulation results on various benchmarks show 27% on average reduction in communication overhead between qubits compared to best results of previous work.},
